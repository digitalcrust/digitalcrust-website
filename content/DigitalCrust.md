**DigitalCrust** is an initiative to bring together geologists who build software to characterize the
Earth's crust. We seek to increase coordination among such geologists working in different organizations and subfields, towards
a goal of producing an integrated, multi-system [[Digital twin of the crust|digital model of the crust]]. Among
our [[DigitalCrust Goals|broad goals]] are to

- Establish systems, datasets, and modeling approaches that collectively describe the Earth's crust across
  space, time, scale of analysis, and process domain
- Encorage practices of [[Code-level collaboration|code-level collaboration]] among geologists
  towards modularity, reusability, and sharing of the [[Software infrastructure|software infrastructure]]
  for digital geological research
- Build [[Software literacy|software literacy]] among early-career scientists to develop contributors
  and decision makers in digital geology
- Develop connectivity among the [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of software and systems for digital crustal research
- Elevate the status of software-oriented work and modes of collaboration alongside more established
  technical areas

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists who are building software infrastructure for the future of the field.
We seek to build a culture of close technical communication and resource sharing that will accelerate, align, and
improve all of our work.

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates,
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
We seek to extend current emphasis on software systems and infrastructure
with a focus on improving the collaborative model for software-based work
in geology.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to establish community integration through concrete, code-level collaboration.
These lightweight collaborative practices are established in the open-source software community
and have proved productive for distributed computational work.
This approach will be developed at virtual meetings, workshops, and training events.
We will also seek to coordinate contributions with other geoscience informatics and software
efforts in our community [[Ecosystem]].

## [[Get involved]]

We're working on establishing how this organization will work – stay tuned for more details.
