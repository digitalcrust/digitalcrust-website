**DigitalCrust** is a community of geologists who build software for geological research. We seek to make it easier to coordinate **across organizations** to build community-level data infrastructure.
We are focused on several [[DigitalCrust Goals|core goals]]:

- Work towards grassroots community development of a [[Digital twin of the crust]] that integrates geological
  information across space and time
- Establish practices of [[Code-level collaboration]] among geoscientists towards
  - [[Software-driven collaboration|Software-mediated connections]] between organizations and subfields
  - Bottom-up tool and infrastructure development
  - Modular, reusable [[Software libraries|software libraries]]
- Encourage [[Software literacy|software literacy]] among geoscientists to enable these collaborative
  ties
- Foster the growth of an informatics [[Ecosystem]] of both [[Software infrastructure]] and scientist-developers within the geoscience community

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists and informatics professionals who seek to
collaborate more closely across organizational bounds

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates, competing platforms, and duplication
of effort between organizations. DigitalCrust advocates for lightweight
collaborative practices borrowed from the open-source software community to
improve community connectivity.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to build coordination through low-overhead virtual meetings
and training and outreach events. It seeks to direct contributions to the many other geoscience informatics and software efforts in our community
[[Ecosystem]]. As a loose collaborative enterprise, it remains open to new
initiatives in the future.

## [[Get involved]]

There are many ways to get involved for geologists of all levels, starting from
simply attending our biweekly standing meeting.
