**DigitalCrust** is a community of geologists who build software for geological
research. We seek to make it easier to **coordinate across organizations** to
build community-level data infrastructure towards a
[[Digital twin of the crust]]. We have several [[DigitalCrust Goals|core goals]]
as part of this decadal[^1] effort.

- Encorage "grassroots" practices of [[Code-level collaboration]] among
  geoscientists.
- Establish [[Software-driven collaboration]] between organizations and
  subfields
- Encourage [[Software literacy|software literacy]] among early-career
  scientists to enable these collaborative ties
- Foster a community [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of both and scientist-developers
  within the geoscience community
- Collaboratively build the [[Software infrastructure|software infrastructure]]
  to integrate geological information across space and time (the
  "[[Digital twin of the crust|Digital Crust]]")

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists and informatics professionals who seek to
collaborate more closely across organizational bounds

</div>

<div className="block">

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates,
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
DigitalCrust advocates for lightweight collaborative practices borrowed from the
open-source software community to improve community connectivity.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to build coordination through low-overhead virtual meetings
and training and outreach events. It seeks to direct contributions to the many
other geoscience informatics and software efforts in our community
[[Ecosystem]]. As a loose collaborative enterprise, it remains open to new
initiatives in the future.

## [[Get involved]]

There are many ways to get involved for geologists of all levels, starting from
simply attending our biweekly standing meeting.

    At least decadal! The idea for a digital crust has been around for years; we
    seek to encourage broad community participation that has been difficult to
    achieve in the past.
