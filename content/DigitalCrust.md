The **DigitalCrust** collaboration brings together geologists who build software to characterize the
Earth's crust. We seek to increase coordination among workers in different organizations and subfields, towards
a goal of producing an integrated, multi-system [[Digital twin of the crust|digital model of the crust]]. Among
our [[DigitalCrust Goals|broad goals]] are to

- Establish systems, datasets, and modeling approaches that collectively describe the Earth's crust across
  space, time, scale of analysis, and process domain
- Encorage [[Code-level collaboration|code-level collaboration]] among geologists
  towards modular, adaptable, and interoperable [[Software infrastructure|software infrastructure]]
  for digital geological research
- Build [[Software literacy|software literacy]] and technical capacity among early-career scientists who might lead future digital geology research
- Develop connectivity among an [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of software and systems for digital crustal research
- Elevate the visibility of software-oriented work and collaboration alongside more established
  geoscience domains

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists who are building software infrastructure for the future of the field.
We seek to build a culture of close technical communication and resource sharing that will accelerate, align, and
improve all of our work.

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research lead
to [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates,
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
We seek to extend current emphasis on software systems and infrastructure
with a focus on improving the collaborative model for software-based work
in geology.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to increase community integration by encouraging code-level collaboration
among organizations. This approach, which prioritizes lightweight, flexible collaboration towards
cross-cutting technical goals, has become central to the open-source software community but is not
yet well developed in academic geoscience.

## [[Get involved]]

This collaboration will mostly seek to coordinate work within an [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of
related efforts, through virtual meetings, workshops, and training events. We're working
on establishing how the organization will work – stay tuned for more details.
