**DigitalCrust** is a community of geologists who build software for
collaborative geological research. We encourage **coordination across
organizations** towards a community-level [[Digital twin of the crust]]. Among
our [[DigitalCrust Goals|broad goals]] are to

- Encorage "grassroots" practices of
  [[Code-level collaboration|code-level collaboration]] among geoscientists.
- Establish [[Software-driven collaboration|software-driven links]] between
  organizations and subfields
- Build [[Software literacy|software literacy]] among early-career scientists to
  enable these collaborative ties
- Foster a vibrant and integrated community [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of
  software-oriented scientists
- Work collaboratively towards a _digital crust_, an open and distributed
  [[Software infrastructure|software infrastructure]] that integrates geological
  information across space and time

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists and informatics professionals who seek to
collaborate more closely across organizational bounds

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates,
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
DigitalCrust advocates for lightweight collaborative practices borrowed from the
open-source software community to improve community connectivity.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to build coordination through low-overhead virtual meetings
and training and outreach events. It seeks to direct contributions to the many
other geoscience informatics and software efforts in our community
[[Ecosystem]]. As a loose collaborative enterprise, it remains open to new
initiatives in the future.

## [[Get involved]]

There are many ways to get involved for geologists of all levels, starting from
simply attending our biweekly standing meeting.

    At least decadal! The idea for a digital crust has been around for years; we
    seek to encourage broad community participation that has been difficult to
    achieve in the past.
