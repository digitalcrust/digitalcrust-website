**DigitalCrust** is an initiative to bring together geologists who build software to characterize the
Earth's crust. We encourage **coordination across organizations** and subfields of geology, with the
goal of producing integrated, multi-system [[digital models of the crust|Digital twin of the crust]]. Among
our [[DigitalCrust Goals|broad goals]] are to

- Work to establish open, distributed, and integrated systems, datasets, and modeling approaches that
  describe the Earth's crust across space, time, and scales of analysis
- Build [[Software literacy|software literacy]] among early-career scientists to catalyze technical innovation
  and effective decision making about harnessing, supporting, and utilize it
- Encorage practices of [[Code-level collaboration|code-level collaboration]] among geologists
  to foster modularity, reusability, and sharing of the [[Software infrastructure|software infrastructure]]
  for digital geological research
- Foster a community [[Ecosystem|ecosystem]] of geologists using software approaches to crustal research
- Elevate the status of software-oriented work and collaboration alongside more established
  technical areas

## [[People]]

DigitalCrust was created by geologists who are building software infrastructure for the future of the field.
We seek to build a culture of close technical communication and resource sharing that will accelerate, align, and
improve all of our work.

## [[Motivation]]

Current collaborative and funding practices for geoinformatics research result
in [[Development silos|development silos]], low community adoption rates,
competing platforms, and duplication of effort between organizations.
DigitalCrust advocates for lightweight collaborative practices borrowed from the
open-source software community to improve community connectivity.

## [[Approach]]

DigitalCrust seeks to build coordination through low-overhead virtual meetings
and training and outreach events. It seeks to direct contributions to the many
other geoscience informatics and software efforts in our community
[[Ecosystem]]. As a loose collaborative enterprise, it remains open to new
initiatives in the future.

## [[Get involved]]

There are many ways to get involved for geologists of all levels, starting from
simply attending our biweekly standing meeting.
