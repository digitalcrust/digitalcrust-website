## 10:30 am: Module 2: Exchange code! (Daven or someone else)

- Fork repo and then clone locally

:::Discussion point You can clone without forking but that makes it harder to
push your changes up :::

- Run code
- Find a problem or improvement

- Sidebar: GitHub Issue? (Response saying “good luck”)
- Address the issue
- Expand capability
- better visual or data transformation
- Push to GitHub fork
