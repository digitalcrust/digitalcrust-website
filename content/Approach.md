There is a long history of organizations that seek to coordinate digital
infrastructure in geology. Unlike previous efforts in the space, we seek to
foster lightweight collaboration, encouraging informal communication and shared
maintenance of small, reusable software libraries.

- Connect geoscientists who are solving problems by building software
- Encourage [[Code-level collaboration]] outside of organizational and funding-driven [[Development silos]]
- Support the development of [[Software libraries]] and shared code infrastructure
- _Open to the contributions_: Encourage contributions from many sources (e.g., enthusiast software professionals) to scientific software 

## Build [[Software literacy]]

- Build a shared vision of a digital crustal research.
- Teach geoscientists how to exist in a software-driven world

## Principles

  - _Broadly focused_: Teach broad skills and approaches, not specific languages
  - _Learn by doing_: Provide ways to contribute that allow students to get onboard and start helping

## Philosophy

- Standards over platforms
- "Community of practice"

## Comparisons

We are similar in concept to other efforts in the wider community [Ecosystem].

- Like EarthCube but from the bottom up (not a platform)
- Like Palaeoverse but for crustal science
- Like Software Underground but more focused on new software. Also a bit more centered within the academic community.
