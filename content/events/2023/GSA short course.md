## Abstract

Increasingly, the future direction of geoscience depends on how we design and
use computational tools. A multiscale, time-integrated “digital crust” that can
be explored, visualized, and integrated into Earth system models is necessary
for future scientific work and requires sustained investment in software
infrastructure, data resources, and community practices. In this course, we will
introduce skills that can help researchers contribute to this vision. We will
cover foundational skills for sustainable digital systems, including software
design, GitHub collaboration, and database management. Furthermore, we will
examine how to integrate such work into a geological research career.

# Schedule

## <span class="meta">Welcome and introduction</span>

<div class="time">9:00 am</div>

- The _digital crust_: a descriptive/process model of the crust through time
- What skills and community structure do we need to get there?

## <span class="meta">Core skill:</span> How to collaborate on code

**Objectives:** Use the [Git](https://git-scm.com) version control tool and the
[GitHub](https://github.com) platform to share and collaborate on geoscience
software.

### <span class="meta">Setup</span>

<div class="time">9:15 am</div>

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### <span class="meta">Module 1:</span> Share

<div class="time">9:45 am</div>

- Create some useful code
- _Commit_ your changes and _push_ them to GitHub

### <span class="meta">Module 2:</span> Contribute

<div class="time">10:30 am</div>

_Build on the contributions of others_

- Identify a potential improvement, and discuss it with the author (GitHub
  issues)
- _Fork_ and _clone_ a repository (get your own local copy)
- Make changes to expand functionality
- Push your changes to GitHub

### <span class="meta">Module 3:</span> Synthesize

<div class="time">11:30 am</div>

- Create a pull request
- Review a pull request
- Merge the updated code into the original repository

**Wrap-up:** How is software collaboration like scientific collaboration?

## <span class="meta">Lunch</span>

<div class="time">12:00 pm</div>

## Open-source workflows

<div class="time">1:30 pm</div>

- Contributing to prose (e.g., this website!)
- Managing large/long-term projects
- Making bite-sized contributions (_the open-source process_)
- _Next steps:_ Software libraries

## Community-building

<div class="time">_panel discussion_, 2:00 pm</div>

- The need for software-driven collaboration in science
- Organizations currently working on the Digital Crust
- What is going well and what is not?
- How do we build the right community structure?

## A science + software career

<div class="time">_panel discussion_, 3:00 pm</div>

- Benefits and challenges of software-driven science
- Breaking out of domain-specific silos
- Alternative career opportunities
- Guest speakers (TBD)

## <span class="meta">Wrap-up discussion</span>

<div class="time">4:15 pm</div>
