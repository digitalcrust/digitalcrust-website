Creating an open and extensible software ecosystem for geoscience is a major endeavour, and there are many organizations involved in pushing it forward. Many of these efforts target the same overall problem as DigitalCrust, but are focused on different facets of the overall problem.

# Collaborative geoscience software

The "digital crust" will be composed of software tools,
in conversation with each other, supported by rich data platforms.
A few software products that are well-established and critical to the vision:

- [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/)
- [MELTS](https://melts.ofm-research.org/)

The community is coalescing around more of these tools!

Some data platforms:

- [Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org/)

Software can also build connective tissue between these
tools (and by extension, their domains of work).
