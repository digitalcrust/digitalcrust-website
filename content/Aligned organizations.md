Creating an open and extensible software ecosystem for geoscience is a major endeavour, and there are many organizations involved in pushing it forward. Many of these efforts target the same overall problem as DigitalCrust, but are focused on different facets of the overall problem.

# Earth-system modeling software

Earth science researchers already produce many software tools that handle different
modeling tasks relevant to individual fields. Some of these are well-established,
mature, and  collaborative enterprises.

- [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/)
- [MELTS](https://melts.ofm-research.org/)

There are many other projects that are at an earlier stage than these large-scale tools.
We encourage the production of more such community-oriented modeling tools.

The "digital crust" arrays these focused tools in conversation with each other, supported by rich data platforms.

## Connective tissue

Software can also build connective tissue between these
tools (and by extension, their domains of work).
