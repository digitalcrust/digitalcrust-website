The DigitalCrust website is a repository that contains both code for rendering
the web page and the page content.

Pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with "wiki
links" to navigate between pages. This link structure can be navigated as a
graph using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app or the
[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) extension for VS Code.

You will need to use Git and GitHub to contribute. But contributing to this
repository is a great way to _learn by doing_ about collaborative development and version-control!

Contributing media (images, videos, etc.) is a bit more complicated. It must be
uploaded to a S3 bucket and linked in pages.

## Using Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a flexible notetaking app with persistent links and visualization tools, which works great for consistent editing across website pages. To use it for your contributions to the website, you'll need to:
- Install and set up [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Clone the [website repository](https://github.com/digitalcrust/digitalcrust-website) to your computer
- Open the [content directory](https://github.com/digitalcrust/digitalcrust-website/tree/main/content) (LocalPath.....\GitHub\digitalcrust-website\content) in Obsidian as a "vault" from an existing folder
- Make edits to the website content directly in Obsidian and commit them to the repository through GitHub Desktop
- Get started on collaborating with all of us to build the geoscience community's informatics capacity!
